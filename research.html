<b><u>VIEW FROM 30,000 FT.</u>:</b>

My general research interest is in software engineering:
<i>designing, specifying, implementing, testing, analyzing, verifying,
understanding,</i> and <i>debugging</i> software written in widely
used programming languages, such as ANSI C and Java.  My focus is on
approaches and methods that naturally give rise to (semi-)automated
tools for programmers, testers, and other software engineers.  The
power of computer science is in automation -- from design to testing,
we need better tools to help us write better programs.
</H3>
<p>
<H4>
My work to date has usually involved some variety of model checking,
but the specifics have varied from full exploration of highly
abstracted systems (with MAGIC) to methods more akin to an unusual
approach to testing (heuristics with JPF, model-driven verification of
C programs with SPIN).  Years of frustration when attempting to
understand counterexamples produced by model checkers have convinced
me that <i>error explanation</i> and <i>fault localization</i> are
important (and <i>interesting</i>) topics, and my thesis work was an
investigation of how a model checker can be used not only to find an
error, but to explain and localize that error.  I made use of distance
metrics on program executions to find causes for errors, in a manner
inspired by the counterfactual theory of causality proposed by David
Lewis.
<p>
More recently, at JPL, I have become interested in the connections
between model checking and (randomized) testing -- including using the
same models and tools for both, reusing simulation infrastructure, and hybrid
approaches such as randomized testing with the complete nondeterminism
of model checking.  More "frivolously" I have also become fascinated
by the taxonomy and nature of actual bugs in programs, particularly
file systems.
<p>
More generally, I see model checking (like well-done testing)
primarily as a useful tool for program understanding -- <b><i>the
investigative side of software engineering</i></b>, if you will.
Model checking traditionally answers the question: does my (program,
protocol, design) have a trace like <i>this</i>?  Testing, in a sense,
answers the same question.  Even at the earliest stages of software
design, thinking about how to make answering that question easier not
only eventually aids verification, but helps us think about how a
program will actually execute.

One interesting possibility to consider is the use of model checking
and other state-space exploration methods to help visualize the
executions of a program.  Recent work at IBM has shown the value of
visualizing memory configurations of large systems; it seems that
program trace-spaces would also be useful in software engineering and
performance debugging.

<b>UPDATE (11/10/10):<b> I'll be chairing <a href = "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/events/SPIN2011/index.htm">SPIN 2011</a>, co-located with CAV 2011 in Snowbird, UT.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (7/1/10):</b> Not updating this site as well as I should... faculty life is busy.  On PC for <a href = "http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/2010/">SAVCBS 2010</a>, NASA Formal Methods 2011, FASE 2011...  Those research changes mostly involve interest in end-user testing/debugging for machine-learned software, with <a href = "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/">Margaret Burnett</a> and fellow CMU-er <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/research/members/wong/index.html">Weng-Keen Wong</a>.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (5/1/09):</b> I'll be on the PC for <a href = "http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/SAVCBS/2009/index.shtml">SAVCBS 2009</a>.  I'll probably be changing research directions in some new and exciting ways (though also continuing past work) as a faculty member at Oregon State University, starting later this summer.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (1/5/09):</b> I'm on the PC for this year's <a href = "http://www.miroslav-velev.com/cfv09.html">Workshop on Constraints in Formal Verification</a>.  Submit away.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (8/5/08):</b> <a href = "cfv08.pdf">Paper</a> for my invited talk at <a href = "http://www.miroslav-velev.com/cfv08.html">CFV'08</a> and <a href = "http://www.uni-koblenz.de/~beckert/verify08/">VERIFY'08</a> gives a nice overview of the file system verification & testing that's occupied my time the last couple of years, and a lot of what LaRS has been up to in general.  Take our conclusions on the success of various methods with a grain of salt -- one lab, a handful of people -- still, I think it's safe to say that for rich properties depending on data, the automated predicate abstraction tools aren't really ready for prime time (unless you have the authors captive, maybe).
<p>
<b>UPDATE (6/26/08):</b> I'll be on the PC for <a href = "http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/SAVCBS/2008/index.shtml">SAVCBS 2008</a>.  I just (a week ago) joined the MSL Flight Software Internal Test (FIT) team as lead developer/designer for the test automation framework.  I don't know how much "research"y testing will be useful here, but after this I might be more worth listening to when I opine that something does or does not work in testing Actual Important Code.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (6/10/08):</b> More papers, first a write-up of some work on
automated testing of models from AI planners, at <a href =
"http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~mjw/mochart/Site/MOCHART-2008.html">MoChArt
2008</a>.  More central to what I've been working on lately, there's
an <a href = "http://www.di.univaq.it/ase2008/">ASE</a> paper, "Random
Test Run Length and Effectiveness," mostly based on the file system
testing here at JPL.  Unfortunately, we don't actually propose a
solution to the problem of selecting an optimal (or even good) test
run length, but the data does demonstrate pretty convincingly (IMO)
that this is a major factor in whether random testing is effective for
a system. This paper wouldn't have been written if not for Carlos
Pacheco asking an innocent question after my ICSE '07 talk.  Makes me
wonder what else you have to luck into getting right in order for
random testing to work (that we're not investigating)...
<p>
<b>UPDATE (5/16/08):</b> Papers at <a href =
"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/woda-2008/">WODA 2008</a> and <a href =
"http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/spin08/">SPIN 2008</a>.  First is on
using SPIN to do both random testing and model checking -- with a
little comparison of the two.  Also sort of an "advertisement" paper,
to see if any other dynamic analysis folks want to use SPIN to do this
kind of thing -- I think we do show that it's pretty darn easy to do.
The second one's a tool paper on heuristics for finding bugs with SPIN
(and they do seem to work surprisingly well, perhaps even better than
the paper suggests, says the slightly dubious third author).  Other
than that, using the ideas in both these papers to test the heck out
of the <a href = "http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/">MSL</a> file storage
modules, with pretty good results (but we'd like to find EVERY LAST
BUG before we head to Mars).

<b>UPDATE (4/14/08):</b> I'll be the invited speaker at the <a href =
"http://www.miroslav-velev.com/cfv08.html">Constraints in Formal
Verification 08</a> workshop in Australia this August, where I'll discuss "Putting Flight Software Through the Paces with Testing, Model Checking, and Constraint-Solving."
<p>
<b>UPDATE (2/19/08):</b> Klaus Havelund and I will be teaching <i>CS
119 Reliable Softare: Testing and Monitoring</i> at Caltech starting
April 1st.  Should be enjoyable --- perhaps I'll know more about how to test sotware after we're done...
<p>
<b>UPDATE (2/5/08):</b> Congratulations to my advisor, <a href =
"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~emc">Ed Clarke</a>, who won this year's <a
href =
"http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/turing-award-07">ACM
Turing Award</a> (along with Emerson and Sifakis) for inventing model checking!
<p>
<b>UPDATE (1/12/08):</b> Presented "Extending Model Checking with
Dynamic Analysis" at <a href = "http://www1.cs.uic.edu/vmcai08/index.php">VMCAI '08</a>.  Preparing a talk on the same rough
topic for this year's <a href =
"http://www.cs.pomona.edu/SoCal2008/program.html">SoCal Workshop on
Programming Languages and Systems</a>, and giving a talk on some
similar themes (at a high level) at Caltech on the 19th.  In general,
this is all looking at the places where model checking and testing
intersect -- when state spaces are too large, and properties too rich
(full functional correctness of a file system, for example) for
automated abstraction, what can we do?  Random testing is useful (I'm
looking at how to wisely carve up a test budget into test runs, with
Jamie Andrews at Western Ontario and RuGang Xu, summer intern '07 from
UCLA), but explicit-state model checking with the expectation that you
won't cover the whole state space seems better for programs well fit
for a small nondeterministic harness.  Where do "design for
testability" and "design for verification" lead?  Not, probably, to
programmers working with temporal logic or theorem provers.

<b>UPDATE (1/5/07):</b> "Randomized Differential Testing as a Prelude
to Formal Verification" was accepted for publication at <a href =

<p>
<hr>
<b>UPDATE (11/5/05):</b> Still working at JPL; still learning the
ropes -- what is involved in this complicated beast they call flight
software?  I've been working on various things, including (with Rajeev
Joshi) analysis (well, bounded model checking in the implementation)
of a program given the knowledge that it produced a given trace -- in
a sense, slicing with a series of printfs produced as the slicing
criteria.

<b>UPDATE (4/27/05):</b> I started work at JPL on Monday; so far, so good.  STTT journal paper on explanation accepted, and starting work on some new topics now.  Lots of very cool things going on at LaRS.
<p>
In other news, JPF was open sourced today!  It took a while, but Willem and Jon and Peter did it; way to go, guys.  The release is <a href = "http://javapathfinder.sourceforge.net/">here</a>, and the Slashdot story(!) is <a href = "http://science.slashdot.org/science/05/04/27/1510204.shtml?tid=160&tid=156&tid=185">here</a>.  Even I felt the effects -- factor of 10 or more boost in hits on my home page today.  I guess Java model checking is famous now?

My undergraduate research involved
an ABTA (Alternating Buchi Tableau Automata) based model-checker for the

Concurrency Workbench of the New Century</a> and simplifications to
ABTAs produced from tableau rules for GCTL* (a modification of the

ABTA model-checking more efficient.  The model-checking algorithm is a
modification of the one described in Girish Bhat's Ph.D. thesis.  <a

<h3>SOFTWARE MODEL CHECKING</h3>
<b>UPDATE (8/16/01):</b>  About to leave NASA Ames Research Center, where I've been working on heuristic search for the <a href = "http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/visser/jpf/">JAVA PathFinder 2</a> with <a href = "http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/visser/">Willem Visser</a> and the other members of the Automated Software Engineering group.  I plan to continue this work during the year; the results so far have been very good, and there remain many avenues to explore.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (1/16/02):</b> A couple of papers to be published: <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~agroce/tacas02.pdf">"Adaptive Model Checking,"</a> by myself, Doron Peled, and Mihalis Yannakakis, to be
published in the proceedings of <a href =

"http://www.iei.pi.cnr.it/ISSTA2002/issta02frame.htm"> ISSTA
2002</a>.  As the semester finishes at CMU, I'm working with Sagar Chaki on predicate abstraction, in particular analyzing automatically discovered predicates, before returning to NASA Ames this summer.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (2/14/03):</b> A couple more papers to be published: <a href
= "icse03.pdf">"Modular Verification of Software Components in C,"</a>
by Sagar Chaki, Edmund Clarke, Alex Groce, Somesh Jha, and Helmut
Veith, to be presented at <a href =
"http://cs.oregonstate.edu/icse2003/"> ICSE 2003</a> and <a href =
"spin03.pdf">"What Went Wrong: Explaining Counterexamples,"</a> with
Willem Visser, to appear in <a href
="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/spin2003/"> SPIN 2003</a>
(SPIN is being held after ICSE this year).

I'm currently investigating optimization for predicate abstraction (for
<a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chaki">Sagar Chaki</a>'s MAGIC tool) and methods for automatically explaining
counterexamples, possibly in the world of autonomous systems.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (5/12/03):</b> Wednesday, May 21st, at 10:00 AM in WH 5409,
I will be presenting my thesis proposal, on the topic: "Explaining
Counterexamples: Causal Analysis and Comparison of Transition
Sequences" <b><a href = "propabs.html">(abstract)</a></b>.  My
committee members are Edmund Clarke, David Garlan, Reid Simmons, and
Willem Visser.
<br>
<br>
<a href = "icse03.pdf">"Modular Verification of Software Components in
C"</a> was one of two ICSE ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award
winners.  <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chaki/magic">The MAGIC tool</a> 
has been officially released.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (6/13/03):</b> My thesis topic has been approved and I am
continuing work on my approach for explaining (and possibly
automatically suggesting fixes for) errors in programs.
<br>
<br>
<a href = "charme03.pdf">"Predicate Abstraction with Minimum
Predicates"</a> was accepted for publication in <a href = "http://www.di.univaq.it/charme2003/">CHARME 2003</a>.

<p>
<b>UPDATE (3/26/04):</b> <a href = "cav04.pdf">"Understanding Counterexamples with <i>explain</i>"</a>
was accepted for publication in CAV 2004.  I'm off tomorrow to Barcelona for ETAPS to present the distance metric paper.  In the meantime, I've implemented distance metric based error explanation for <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chaki/magic">MAGIC</a>, and it's working quite nicely.
<p>
I forgot to mention the journal version of the ICSE paper also being accepted (see <a href = "pubs.html">publications page</a>).
<p>
<b>UPDATE (6/11/04):</b> <a href = "fse04.pdf">"Explaining Abstract Counterexamples"</a> will appear at <a href = "http://www.isr.uci.edu/FSE-12/">FSE</a> (Foundations of Software Engineering) in November.  <a href = "bmc04.pdf">"Making the Most of BMC Counterexamples"</a> has been accepted for <a href = "http://bmc04.inf.ethz.ch/">BMC'04</a>, the second workshop on Bounded Model Checking.

(two weeks from now) and will be starting work at JPL's 
<a href = "http://eis.jpl.nasa.gov/lars/">Laboratory for Reliable Software (LaRS)</a> as soon as I finish up at CMU (and move to
California).  It should be a great opportunity to do some serious model
checking research with real-world (and other-worldly!) examples.
<p>
My <a href = "thesis.pdf">thesis draft</a> looks to be in good shape for public release, though I expect to be tweaking it until the defense or shortly thereafter.
<p>
<b>UPDATE (3/3/05):</b> Successful thesis defense today!  I will be
making some changes to address a few points that need to be clarified,
and then, well, it's on to Mars, so to speak...
