Education:
  * Ph.D., Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2004 (expected).

  * B.S., Computer Science, North Carolina State University, May 1999 (summa cum laude).
  * B.S., Multidisciplinary Studies, North Carolina State University, May 1999 (summa cum laude).
*       Minors:  English Literature and  Science, Technology, and Society.

Research Interests:
* Specifying, testing, verifying, and debugging software written in widely used programming languages, such as ANSI C and Java.

Topics:
*  Software model checking:  I have investigated the use of fast SAT procedures for bounded model checking (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/cbmc/) and predicate abstraction based model checking (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chaki/magic/).  Model checking research can produce practical tools for developers of critical software in real-world languages and environments.
*  Error explanation:   I have developed automatic tools for explaining and localizing errors in ANSI C and Java source code.  Understanding and correcting errors can be as difficult and costly as implementation or design.  My thesis work on this topic indicates a promising future for model checking for purposes of automated debugging.
*  Coverage for model checking: I am interested in coverage metrics and certification methods for model checkers.  Traditional and cutting-edge measures from the world of testing can be applied to model checking runs, and proof-based techniques for certification have recently appeared.  However, the general problem remains:  after verification, how much confidence should we have in in the correctness of a program?


Research Experience:
  *  8/1999--present -- Ph.D. student, Carnegie Mellon
  University.  Invented methods for error explanation and fault
  isolation using model checking and distance metrics.  Invented and
  implemented novel and successful approaches for counterexample
  guided abstraction refinement.

  *  5/2002--8/2002 --  Summer Student Research Program, RIACS/NASA Ames Research Center, Automated Software Engineering group.  Invented and implemented methods for error explanation, using model checking counterexamples to provide automatic feedback about the causes and location of errors in Java programs.

  *  5/2001--8/2001 --  Summer Student Research Program, RIACS/NASA Ames Research Center, Automated Software Engineering group.  Invented and experimented with novel (and successful) heuristics for model checking Java programs; implemented heuristic search in the Java PathFinder 2 model checker.

  *  5/2000--8/2000 --  Research intern, Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill).  Implemented black box checking algorithm (model checking for an unknown model using FSM learning algorithms) and investigated theoretical aspects and applications of the algorithm to software model checking.

  *  5/1999--8/1999 -- Summer research assistant, SUNY Stony Brook.  Continued work from the previous summer on ABTAs.

  *  5/1998--8/1998 -- Summer research assistant, North Carolina State University.   Implemented a model checker based on Alternating Buechi Tableau Automata and developed logical optimizations for ABTAs.

   *  Spring 2000 -- Teaching assistant, Carnegie Mellon
   University, for undergraduate course 15-312, Foundations of
   Programming Languages.  Formulated tests and assignments, graded
   assignments and tests, taught a weekly recitation session, and held
   weekly office hours.

   *  Fall 1998 -- Teaching assistant, North Carolina State
   University, for undergraduate course CSC417, Theory of
   Programming Languages.  Graded assignments and held weekly office hours.

   *  Fall 1997, Spring 1998 -- Teaching assistant, North
   Carolina State University, for undergraduate course CSC210,
   Programming Concepts.  Graded assignments and held weekly office
   hours.

   *  Spring 1997 -- Teaching assistant, North
   Carolina State University, for CSC495C,
   Special Topics.  Graded assignments and held weekly office
   hours.  This was a class for professional C programmers in industry
   learning C++ and object-oriented design.
