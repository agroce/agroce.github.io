\begin{Research Interests}
\item \emph{Designing}, \emph{specifying}, \emph{coding},
  \emph{testing}, \emph{verifying}, \emph{understanding}, and
  \emph{debugging} complex computer systems.   My research has combined testing, static analysis, formal methods, programming
  languages, and machine learning approaches as required.  My current focus is on techniques for testing critical systems including JavaScript engines and other compilers, web browsers, file systems, and more generally, all layers of the Android environment, from system libraries to user applications.
  In the spirit of Henry Petroski's proposal that progress in
  engineering arises from understanding failures, I believe that a
  deeper understanding of {\bf bugs} is essential to better
  \emph{software and systems engineering} and better engineering
  education.
\begin{Topics}
\item {\bf Software testing:} I am exploring the effectiveness and relative ease of (randomized) testing, and the relationship between testing, runtime verification or dynamic analysis, and model checking using unsound abstractions --- including shared models and frameworks for testing and model checking and strategies based on constraint-solving and machine learning.
\item {\bf Software model checking:}  I continue to investigate the use of SAT and SMT solvers for bounded model checking (CBMC), predicate abstraction-based approaches (MAGIC, SATABS), and explicit-state exploration with SPIN and Java PathFinder. 
\item {\bf Error explanation:}   I developed automatic tools based on model checking for \emph{explaining} and \emph{localizing} errors in systems.  Understanding and correcting errors can be as difficult and costly as implementation or design, and better methods and algorithms are critical to improving systems reliability.
\item{\bf Understanding complex program executions:} I am working with scientists at the United States Forest Service to analyze complex models used to predict climate change impacts, with techniques that should also apply to analyzing model checking and test system executions.
\item{\bf Educational use of analysis tools:}  I am interested in incorporating mature, robust ``research'' tools for system design, debugging, and verification (model checking, random testing, static analysis, delta-debugging, etc.) into engineering education:  I believe such tools not only make for better engineering practice, but make the learning experience more rewarding and interesting to students.
\comment{
\item {\bf Coverage for model checking:} I am interested in coverage metrics and certification methods for model checkers.  Traditional and cutting-edge measures from the world of testing can be applied to model checking runs, and proof-based techniques for certification have recently appeared.  However, the general problem remains:  after verification, how much confidence should we have in in the correctness of a program?}
