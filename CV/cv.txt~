Education
  * Ph.D., {\bf Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2004 (expected).

  * B.S., {\bf Computer Science, North Carolina State University, May 1999 (\emph{summa cum laude).
  * B.S., {\bf Multidisciplinary Studies, North Carolina State University, May 1999 (\emph{summa cum laude).
*  \hspace{0.5in Minors:  {\bf English Literature and {\bf Science, Technology, and Society.
\end{Education

Research Interests
* Specifying, testing, verifying, and debugging software written in widely used programming languages, such as ANSI C and Java.
Topics
* {\bf Software model checking:  I have investigated the use of fast SAT procedures for bounded model checking (\url{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/cbmc/) and predicate abstraction based model checking (\url{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chaki/magic/).  Model checking research can produce practical tools for developers of critical software in real-world languages and environments.
* {\bf Error explanation:   I have developed automatic tools for \emph{explaining and \emph{localizing errors in ANSI C and Java source code.  Understanding and correcting errors can be as difficult and costly as implementation or design.  My thesis work on this topic indicates a promising future for model checking for purposes of automated debugging.
* {\bf Coverage for model checking: I am interested in coverage metrics and certification methods for model checkers.  Traditional and cutting-edge measures from the world of testing can be applied to model checking runs, and proof-based techniques for certification have recently appeared.  However, the general problem remains:  after verification, how much confidence should we have in in the correctness of a program?

  guided abstraction refinement.

  * {\bf 5/2002--8/2002 $\cdot$  Summer Student Research Program, RIACS/NASA Ames Research Center, Automated Software Engineering group.

  * {\bf 5/2001--8/2001 $\cdot$  Summer Student Research Program, RIACS/NASA Ames Research Center, Automated Software Engineering group.  Invented and experimented with novel (and successful) heuristics for model checking Java programs; implemented heuristic search in the Java PathFinder 2 model checker.

  * {\bf 5/2000--8/2000 $\cdot$  Research intern, Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill).  Implemented black box checking algorithm (model checking for an unknown model using FSM learning algorithms) and investigated theoretical aspects and applications of the algorithm to software model checking.
