\par }{\f2 \tab The fog caused Robert to hit the dog.  The damned animal ran right in front of him, and although he slammed on the brakes and swerved, his car struck it with a sickening crunch as his head slammed into the steering wheel.
\par \tab He sat shaking for five minutes.  Then he pulled himself together and stepped out to examine the damage.
\par \tab The front of his car was destroyed, black hair and red blood and ripped flesh matted all along the crushed hood and front fender.  Glass was everywhere.  He turned away, almost sick.  The fog was thicker there, where the woods began, and he couldn
\rquote t make out the dog\rquote s body anywhere along the road or on the edge of the trees.
\par \tab He walked up and down the road, searching without result, looking at the spot of blood on the highway with his 
flashlight again and again as if it would tell him where the dog had been thrown.  In the fog the light was almost useless, penetrating only a few feet into the thick white murk.
\par \tab Robert saw, as he walked back beyond the point of the accident, a house just off the road.  He\rquote 
d never seen it before, although it was an older house.  He decided to call the police to make an insurance report, and call his wife to tell her that he would be home late tonight, if at all.
\par \tab It was possible the dog belonged to the house, but surely they would understand it hadn\rquote t been his fault--the dog had bounded out of nowhere, huge and black against the drifting fog.
\par \tab He walked up to the door, wet leaves crunching under his feet, the sound eerily echoing around him.  It was a very 
old house, its white paint almost completely peeled away to reveal the dark wood beneath.  A dim light shone behind the drawn yellow curtains beside the front door.  Robert knocked three times, loudly.
\par \tab No one answered.  He tried to peek through the curtains, but could not see inside.  He knocked again, then again.  Still no reply came.  It was cold, even for early November, and he almost wished he\rquote 
d stayed with Janet.  But no, he reflected, that was impossible.
\par \tab He stepped away from the porch, and observed a distant light, far across the yard.  More leaves crunched, and halfway to the little building he stumbled over a mound of freshly turned earth in the yard.  \'93Damn!\'94
  Robert walked more slowly, stepping gingerly so as not to pain his turned ankle.
\par \tab The light came from a cinder-block building, tucked under the edge of the trees, something like a storage shed.  The door was cracked, and he could feel the warmth escaping the place as he stood hesitantly.  \'93Hello.  Hello?\'94
\par \tab No answer came, and he walked insid
e.  The room was a strange combination of laboratory and tool-shed.  Wooden tables were scattered about haphazardly, some covered with beakers and flasks and Bunsen burners, piping and thermometers, some covered with saws and wrenches and vices.  An old i
r
on furnace hulked in one corner, providing the room with warmth.  The grate was open and he could see the flames roaring inside.  Their crackle and the steady drip of liquid from a test tube hanging upside down over a steady blue burner flame were the onl
y sounds in the room.
\par \tab Suspended above all this were nine spheres, perfect globes of thin glass hanging from the ceiling by wires.  He stepped closer, curious.  They were in a row over the most cluttered of the lab tables.  Inside eight of the nine spheres 
were black flies.  He puzzled over them, staring at the three flies in the ninth sphere as they stared back at him, multiplying his gaze by a hundred-fold.  The flies buzzed around, silent in their prisons.
\par \tab \'93I take it that is your car in front of my house?\'94  His heart skipped a beat, and Robert turned to see an elderly man dressed in a wrinkled black suit awkwardly balancing on a cane in the doorway.
\par \tab \'93Yes.  I\rquote m sorry to intrude.\'94  Robert talked too rapidly, out of breath.  \'93I think I hit your dog, and I wanted to see if he was all right but I couldn\rquote t find him, it\rquote s so foggy.  You see?  And I need to use the phone.
\'94
\par \tab The old man\rquote s small eyes focused sharply on his face.  \'93Yes, I could see what had happened.  Of course you can use the phone.  I am sorry if I startled you.  I noticed you admiring my flies.\'94
\par \tab \'93Yes.  It\rquote s. . . interesting.  I\rquote m not sure what they\rquote re for, I must confess.  It reminds me of those ships in a bottle they sell, you wonder how they get them in there, you know?\'94
\par \tab The old man smiled, his bloodless lips turning upwards.  \'93
Yes.  It is something like that.  I am a hobbyist, a dabbler.  Retired biologist, study of life, and the opposite, as you may understand.  Those flies are something I occupy myself with now that I\rquote m not researching.  Wha
t do you think they live upon, sealed in there like that?  You can see there are no holes.\'94
\par \tab Robert looked again at the flies.  \'93I don\rquote t know.  What?\'94
\par \tab \'93Think about it.  It is actually something of a trick question.  Decidedly a trick question.  What do my flies }{\i\f2 live}{\f2  upon?\'94  Robert didn\rquote t answer, and a heavy silence followed.
\par \tab Finally, the old man spoke again.  \'93Did you see the body?\'94
\par \tab \'93No.  I looked, but I couldn\rquote t find it.\'94
\par \tab \'93He is a remarkably tough animal, and may have lived.  If so, he probably ran away from you, hurt as he was.  I\rquote ll go call him, and see if he comes.  You can stay here.  I\rquote ll be back in a minute, and let you use the phone.  I\rquote 
d best go see if he\rquote s suffering first, though.\'94
\par \tab The old man turned and hobbled out.  Robert looked around, waiting and thinking about Janet\rquote s expression when he\rquote 
d hit her.  He heard the tinkle of glass shattering behind him and turned to see a vial broken on the floor, a pool of black liquid forming from it, turning blood red as it was exposed to the air.  A dark 
vapor began to emerge from the spill, and he stared at it, unable to think clearly.  He coughed, inhaling the reddish mist, and then felt the bare gray walls closing in on him.  Robert heard a distant rhythmic chanting, a solemn ritual at a distance.

He rubbed his eyes.  He almost fell when he moved towards the black book lying on the table above the stain, but regained his balance.  The words on the page seemed to float a few inches above the volume, hanging in the air.  He read:
\par \tab }{\i\f2 \'93But, say the heterodox, would not then all who perform this act be as trapped as their victims, just as the one whom they act for is trapped?  The orthodox reply that this is precisely their point.\'94
\par }{\f2 \tab Robert\rquote s head swam, and he was filled with a vague terror.  He walked outsi
de, and although the night air was cold and impossible to see through, it did not make him nauseous.  He breathed deeply, then went to look for the old man.  He called and hunted up and down the highway, stopping by the wreck of his car.  He returned and 
saw that the front door of the house was open.
\par \tab The living room was drab and poorly furnished, the colors ranging from the faded brown of the couch to the faded yellow of the rug.  The phone was on the table, a black rotary number that might have been Alexander Graham Bell\rquote 
s first sale. Robert called out for the man.  \'93Hello!  Are you around?\'94
\par \tab He heard something from the next room, though not an answer.  It was the loud tick of an old clock in what he decided must be the old man\rquote s bedroom.  The bed was neat
ly made, with brown sheets and unwashed stains on the white pillows.  The room was almost empty.  There was the bed, and the clock, and a large painting on the wall above the headboard.
\par \tab It was a hideous painting, showing a horrible red creature with claws and fangs and hundreds of twisting horns.  The thing\rquote 
s feet were invisible, encased in ice.  It held a man in each of its hands, blood dripping from them where its claws ripped them, and a third man was in its mouth, impaled on the fangs and strangled by its mottled tongue.
\par \tab Robert swallowed and left quickly.  He sat down and picked up the phone and dialed home.
\par \tab After too many rings, Elizabeth answered.  \'93Hello.\'94  Her voice was muffled, as if at a great distance.
\par \tab \'93It\rquote s Robert.  I was working late, and I hit some man\rquote s dog, so I\rquote m going to have to wait till the cops can write me up for insurance, and see if they can give me a ride, but I\rquote ll be home before morning.\'94
\par \tab \'93Okay.  I\rquote ll be here.  My plane doesn\rquote t leave until one, so we can talk in the morning.\'94
\par \tab \'93Yeah, honey.  I know.  We may have time.  Listen, I\rquote ve got to call the cops, so I\rquote m going to let you go.  I love you, okay?\'94
\par \tab Her voice faded even more as she answered him.  \'93I love you, too.  Talk in the morning.\'94  Then he hung up.
\par \tab He called Janet.  \'93Robert?\'94  Her voice, too, was muffled.  Something was wrong with the phone here, but that was hardly surprising, considering its age.
\par \tab \'93Yes.  Listen, I\rquote m sorry I hit you.  I was mad.  You shouldn\rquote t have said that about her, you shouldn\rquote t.  I don\rquote t love her, but I don\rquote t want to hear that.  She\rquote s my wife.\'94
\par \tab \'93That\rquote s no reason. . .\'94  She either cut the sentence short, or the line cut off her last words.
\par \tab \'93I know.  I shouldn\rquote t have.  Look, we can talk about it later.  I just wanted to say I\rquote m sorry.  Is your eye okay?\'94
\par \tab Her voice was breaking up, silence covering most of her words.  \'93Yes. . . talk. . . ice. . . swelling. . . . Love. . .\'94
\par \tab \'93I\rquote m still going home tonight.  If I can--I had a wreck, car\rquote s totaled.  Guess the cops will run me home.\'94
\par \tab \'93Are you. . .  stay here. . .  Robert. . . don\rquote t have a home anymore, there. . .\'94  The anger was gone from her voice, and only sadness remained.
\par \tab \'93I can\rquote t hear you.  This is a bad line.  I love you, okay?\'94
\par \tab She faded away completely, and he hung up, wondering what he was going to do.
\par \tab When he tried to call the police he received only a hollow sound, like the ocean in a seashell, a void at a great distance.  The smell of decay filled the house, bringing back his dizziness.  He slammed the phone down and went outside.
\par \tab The dog wa
s a few yards away, behind a tree, staring at him.  It was a huge, ugly brute of a dog, black as night, its muscles sleek and threatening.  He turned on the porch light and could see that it was bleeding badly.  Some of the blood came from the left side o
f its head, where one eye was gone and the jaw was torn open, but most of it came from a stump on the side of its neck, a bulge of raw flesh that did not belong on any animal.  A mournful howl came from the dog\rquote s direction, but the dog\rquote 
s ruined jaw didn\rquote t move.  Robert edged farther away from the thing.
\par \tab The dog bounded away into the shadows, swallowed in an instant by the mist.  He hunted in the fog for the old man or the dog, but soon returned to the shed.  The air had cleared, and the stain was almost gon
e.  Robert observed that a fly had appeared in the third globe, which had been empty before.  It followed his hand when he waved it in front of the glass, landing on the inside surface when he lowered his arm.
\par \tab Robert pondered again the \'93trick question.\'94  If he knew how the fly had been placed inside, he would know how sustenance was provided.  But both seemed impossible.
\par \tab A leather book-marker was draped across the black tome on the table below the flies, and he moved it to read the words:
\par \tab }{\i\f2 \'93Certain souls may be captured after death in this manner, trapped by all the lies that were their lives.  The heterodox propose that this ritual\rquote 
s efficacy proves the nonexistence of Hell.  The orthodox suggest, rather, that it is a proof of its existence:  those trapped in this way are truly in Hell, and those who trap them act as surrogates for the master of that infinite prison.\'94
\par }{\f2 \tab He idly turned the page, and saw familiar words floating above the book, which he quickly shut.
\par \tab Through the window looking o
ut onto the side yard, he saw the old man.  He was behind the house, with a shovel.  A great heap of dirt was slowly forming beside him, and Robert was amazed at how ably he turned the earth for a man of his age.  Then Robert saw what was being buried.

\par \tab Despairing fury seized Robert, and he picked up the cane the old man had discarded, now lying in the corner.  He smashed the dripping test tube with it, flinging white precipitate and glass shards all over the room.
\par \tab He then turned his wrath on the flies and attempted to break the third sphere.  It survived the blow and began to swing back and forth like a madman\rquote s pi\'f1
ata.  He struck it again and again, without result, and finally, despairing, hurled the old man\rquote s cane into the furnace.  He waited until the shaft sticking out caught fire, and left while it was still burning.
\par \tab He passed the old man and returned to the highway.  His car was gone and his flashlight revealed a fresh oil puddle where it had been, a slick rainbow pool in the light.
\par \tab He began to walk slowly down the road through the woods.  Just beyond him he heard the quietly arguing voices of Janet and Elizabeth, almost distinguishable from each other.  The voices retreated as he approached, always just beyond.
