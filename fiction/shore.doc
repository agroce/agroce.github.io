a fairly small grassy clearing surrounded by thick pine woods. Firewood lay heaped in the center.  That wood is now burning behind me, the flames reflected in the screen as I write.  I\rquote 
ve moved away from the fire--the wind is still, and the smoke and heat 
are hovering above the fire, slowly drifting away into the darkening sky.  My eyes were beginning to burn, so I retreated to this distance, although I felt safer beside the fire.  The smoke seems to rise up forever, and it is hard for me not to discover s
hapes in its amorphous trail.

\par \tab \'93After this was done, God put Adam to sleep.  He took one of his ribs, and then closed up the hole.  From Adam\rquote s rib, God made the first woman.  When he brought her to him, Adam looked at her.  \lquote This is bone of my bone, and flesh 
of my flesh.  Because she was taken out of Man, she shall be called Woman.\rquote   And so Adam named the last creature.\'94

s trampoline, which was actually an old inner tube with a rubber sheet stretched across the hole.  I landed wrong, and it flipped me up and then down onto the ground on my back.  I couldn\rquote 
t walk for five days, and lay in the little bedroom in the old house, flat on my back, holding books up above my head to read until my arms grew tired and I went to sleep, then woke up to read some more.
\par \tab I remember that room almost as well as my own.  The walls were white, and bumpy like the ceiling in my own house.  Grandma\rquote s closet was in the corner opposite my head, where she kept the black straw broom that made 
my cousin Henry and me think she was a witch.  She helped us reach this conclusion by never letting us play in the living room after the time I spun Henry around in the chair so fast that he fell out and cracked his head on the coffee table.  He bled and 
b
led all over his Sunday clothes and all over my clothes and all over the carpet.  There was a cracked mirror on the side of the closet, which came out a little into the room.  Beside the mirror hung an old calendar, made of cloth, for the impossibly dista
nt year of 1954.
\par \tab It is this calendar that brought to my mind this whole sequence--isn\rquote t it curious how the smallest things can pull back the past to us, in full?  The passage of the seasons was illustrated on that calendar by four illustrations woven into 
the background.  The wooden dipper on this well is notched in precisely the way as that depicted in the scene of summer on my Grandmother\rquote 
s calendar, with the same rusted iron rings holding it together.  As soon as I saw it, I knew.  All memories, perhaps,
 arise from such trivial keys, provided either by the world or by our own desire to look back.  Certainly that chipped bucket has unlocked the entire room from my vaults.
\par \tab Papa\rquote s dresser was black oak, curved in front, and always covered with a white cloth
.  The bed was brass, with knobs that I would reach my hands out to hold as I lay flat, pretending my hands were chained and I was a prisoner of the evil warlord, or the Russians, or whoever my enemies were at the time.
\par \tab At night, after Mom turned out the lights and I couldn\rquote 
t follow the Hardy Boys any more, I would lie awake for hours, listening to Papa clatter about the house past midnight, and thinking that in winter I would be able to sleep because the sound of the furnace turning on and off with its lo
ud coughs and dull clangs would distract me from my thoughts.
\par \tab I think that I miss that room more than I miss my own.  It seems to me that my visits to Grandma and Papa\rquote s house were more important, and certainly more fraught with mystery and wonder, than t

Several days have passed, I believe.  At first I feverishly wandered in wild dreams and fierce memories, hurled almost bodily into other days.  That delirium (not entirely delirium) is gone, and today I only feel the shadowy presence of a quiet day spent 
at my uncle\rquote s house on the lake, eating and swimming with my family, lazily napping in the sun.  This is the peace after war.

e window is open, and a slight breeze causes me to pull my blanket tighter.
