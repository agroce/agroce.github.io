however, as you will see, this is also open to debate.  Some would argue that the conditions the prisoner describes are for the most part universal throughout human experience; Storr has suggested that this is the true note of the manuscript\rquote

\par \tab Dr. Johnson said \'93Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\'94  This is so.
\par \tab \'93First,\'94 they say, \'93we will remove your eyeballs.  You must believe that this will be more painful than you can
 imagine.  Then, having blinded you, we will amputate your limbs, making sure to staunch the flow of blood; you see, we wish you to live some time.\'94
\par \tab At this point they always apply a burning iron to my back, and if I only knew what sign it was they brande
d me with I should be much better off.  The dream ends when I see the scalding tongs descending towards my eyes.  Sometimes the order is reversed and they amputate my arms and legs before blinding me.  This is excruciating, but bearable because I am aware
 it is only a premonition of what is to come.
\par \tab As I mentioned ear
lier, the warden denies all this.  He has just left, again.  There are two possibilities:  I am here because they want something from me (I have a secret, I have a secret) or because I want something from them (in which case I also have a secret, but they
 do not know it).
\par \tab The warden\rquote s story is highly unlikely.  That I would be so stupid as to assault an officer of the law is unbelievable.  If he insulted my woman (had I a woman) I would, perhaps, kill a member of the Securitet, but I would not get into a b
arroom brawl with him.  Therefore, if the story is true, then it means that I was seeking imprisonment.  Anyway, if a woman were so important to me I would remember her.
\par \tab The essential questions for you, my reader, are the same ones I ask myself:  who am I and what am I doing here?  And whose are the wings I hear beating in my dream?

many of them do not (again, this is what the warden claims) even remember why they are here.  They are pleasant, but usually somewhat distant, and many are afflicted with memory disorders, ranging from eidetic, bu

of such great age that they are the most laughable of revolutionaries.

\par \tab The duration of the prisoner\rquote s stay in the \'93Bastille\'94 is a matter of considerable controversy.  Certain modern techniques of psychological treatment can produce a temporal disorientation similar to that a
pparently experienced by the prisoner.  Crantree suggests that a similar technique may have been employed by the pre-revolutionary government to rehabilitate prisoners.  The length of the final (and still incomplete) document suggests a period of at least

\par \tab Should this record survive me, they may alter it.  Reader, beware!  In fact, the text you see may not be what I wrote, or, more importantly ma
y be a carefully selected and misleading portion of the whole.  The ravings of a madman are one thing, and these \'93notes from underwater\'94 as I should call them, are another.
\par \tab However, I believe that I have found a solution to this problem.  I have encrypted the whole within a portion\emdash 
the very part of this document that for their own devious purposes they will maintain unaltered is, in fact, a cryptogram that encapsulates the everything.
\par \tab I will not have time to complete my work, though, if they insist upon letting me go.

\par \tab The warden showed me a picture of his daughter today.  It is strange to think that he has a life outside of this place.  At the end of the day he leaves the \'93Bastille\'94
 and walks through the back alleys to a tiny, dirty apartment in the Old Town.  He is as alone there as I am in my cell, and, ironically, does not even own a record player although he gave me one for Christmas
, (with some appropriate music, thus breaking two laws at once).  He is alone by choice--he sent little Eleanor abroad when the political situation became intolerable.  She is a small child, frail and birdlike, with a halo of fragile golden hair--complete
ly unlike her father in appearance.  Her mother died in the Fever of 610.  She must have been a beautiful woman.

\par \tab We witnessed an execution today, the first in months.  The Warden (Harding--he trusts me enough to tell me his name--I wish that I could return 
the favor), as is customary, did not appear before the public, but watched from inside.  My window provides an excellent view of the front yard.
\par \tab A large crowd was allowed inside the walls to watch the poor woman die.  The soldiers, in their brown dress uniforms, kept their rifles trained on the crowd, which ruined the effect of the military display.
\par }\pard \ql \fi720\li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f2 Another group of soldiers, rifles properly shouldered, escorted the prisoner from the door.  They brought her to Mr. Guillotine.  It is interesting that (at le
ast as I saw it) only two of the hundreds of figures below were distinguishable, anything but faceless members of the mob or the rifle squad.  The central actor in the drama, of course, was the woman about to be executed.  She could not have been much old
e
r than twenty, and was breathtakingly beautiful.  She wore a pale sea-green dress, quite elegant, although not the present fashion.  Her hair was a smoldering red, and hung to her waist, unbound.  It was the brightest thing in the drab prison yard; in ear
ly winter the grass takes on a ghastly gray shade and the lonely tree is stark and barren.  She looked back and up at the Bastille for a moment, as if to greet the Warden and myself, or, more likely, to see her \'93home\'94
 for the last time.  Her face was pale and soft, already like an aging photograph--of a woman who was a beauty in her prime in the oldest living man\rquote s childhood, but, the old man sighs, \'93is now gone down to dust these forty years.\'94
  There was a dignity in her expression  and bearing that was almost unbearable to watch.
\par The other figure was Mr. Guillotine, the executioner.  He was dressed in white, from head to toe, even his boots, and wore the mask of a skull.  He was a head taller than any of the others gathered below, and his shoulders were mor
e than broad enough to match his height.  I wonder still how his identity was kept a secret; the mask hid his face, but surely he was recognizable in his outside life by his stature?  The only solution that I can offer is that he was a prisoner himself--p
erhaps with his death sentence altered to one of half-life, half-(acting as the agent of)-death.
\par Only two real people in the whole crowd, and one of them not a person but a thing, the face behind the mask of reality, the grinning skull always leering at you behind your back.  Death and the maiden.
\par She kneeled under the tree, and placed her head on the block.  A soldier stepped up and cut her hair.  It was a butchery, as savage as the execution in its own way.  When he was finished, her neck was bare.
\par The sho
uts of the crowd were becoming more bloodthirsty.  The Warden whispered to me that she was as unpopular with them as with the government; the reforms she had been foolish enough to suggest pleased neither the satisfied rich nor the rapacious poor.  It was
 not those reforms but the motivations behind them, he added, that had ensured her sentence.  The judge had explained the importance of maintaining the \'93sacred\'94 (how ironic) Separation.
\par Mr. Guillotine lifted the axe from beside the block and tested its edge
 against his gloved hand.  Satisfied, he raised it high in the air.  The girl on the block still said nothing, still refused to cry or scream, which angered the now roaring crowd.  As the mob drew closer to the tree the soldiers tightened their line.  The
 drum-roll ended and I turned away from the window.  I did not hear the axe fall, it is only a small sound, though sickening if you are close enough to hear it.  Only the cheers ensured me that justice had been done.
\par Perhaps she was my wife, and now I am a widower.  She was young enough to be my daughter.  God have mercy on our souls.
\par The warden told me this morning that the }{\i\f2 Institute de Physic}{\f2  announced today the discovery of a new particle.  The quantum of time, the chronon.  While we played darts, careful
 not to bury any of them in the finely paneled oak walls of the cell, he explained the significance of the discovery.  He thinks that I may have had a scientific career before my unfortunate loss of memory, and so is always telling me these things.
\par The chronon has both imaginary mass and charge (0+}{\i\f2 ei}{\f2  and 0-}{\i\f2 ei}{\f2 
, respectively), and that it is the fact that it has no anti-particle that provides time with a direction.  All physical processes would otherwise be symmetric, and past and present would be indistingui
shable.  It is only this mathematical quirk that makes yesterday more known but infinitely less reachable to us than tomorrow.  Below the unit of time marked by the quantity of the chronon, the arrow points both ways.
\par The physicists verified the existence of time by detecting the decay of a chronon.  The Warden offered an interesting suggestion.  \'93Since,\'94 he said, \'93
the chronon decays into something else that we have no name or theory for, but that is definitely not a temporal particle, and all chronons will
 eventually decay, although their half-life is provably unknowable, is it not the case that time has, in a sense, already come to a halt?  If it ever will, which it must, then it has already--only this is undetectable to our instruments.\'94
  Protons decay, so matter will eventually come to an end, but to imagine that time will also end, perhaps before that (in which case the protons will not decay, because there will be no time to measure half-lives by?) is strange.  
\par The girl is always on the block, the axe 
is always raised.  I am always a free man, and the warden is always smiling beatifically as his hypothesis is concluded and he buries his last dart in the bullseye.  We are all, always, about to die, are dying, are dead.  In fact, at every moment we are a
live, there are vast, unimaginable orders of magnitude more moments in which we are dead, \'93before\'94 and \'93after,\'94
 if those terms even apply (and so this is, like all tales told by men, a ghost story).  Our heads are always on the block, and thus, I suppose, by Johnson\rquote s dictum, our minds should always be clear.

NOTE:  The techniques and costumes of execution employed in the Bastille have been commented on at length by Tyris and Fidd (other common combinations include a sword and a traditional headsman\rquote s garb, and an electrical \'93apparatus\'94
 and technician\rquote s uniform; for ceremonial events such as regicides wood and nails are employed).  Executioners were usually selected, as the prisoner proposes, from the population of the prison.  Usually, a death sentence was
 commuted in exchange for the prisoner\rquote s cooperation.  It is interesting to speculate as to who would have carried out the executions if the \'93executioners\'94
 had refused the deal.  Eventually, one supposes, a prisoner willing to serve was always found.  The results of the chronon experiment have been challenged in recent years.  The prisoner\rquote

\par \tab A single letter was a rare occurrence in this forsaken place.  Two epistles, when he had dreamed of a messenger the night before, was a sign or po
rtent, and no coincidence.  The difference between dream and reality was, admittedly, extreme.  The warden tried to imagine a greater contrast than that between the faceless guard who had delivered his mail and the burning angel of his dream, and failed. 
 
The guard had been exactly six feet tall,  a little shorter than the warden.  The angel had towered above the night sky, at a height that was impossible and indeed far more fearsome than if it had been infinite--one word sufficed to quantify infinite heig
ht, while no words could have expressed the distance between the angel\rquote 
s face and his own.  The guard had been dressed in the constant gray of the prison, while the angel had been clothed in fire and white light;  it had perhaps been naked, but shielded by 
its own magnificence.  The guard had delivered two unremarkable envelopes.  The angel had spoken words of thunder and lightning, conveying something of all-consuming importance.  The messages of the guard were still with him, unopened.  The message of the
 angel had been lost when he had awoken and had left him with an impression of immeasurable loss.
\par \tab He sighed and placed the book on his shelf, between the Bible and a collection of chaos poetry.  The warden slit the first envelope with the letter opener his
 mother had given him to celebrate his first assignment.  He pulled a sheet of white paper from it and read:

 was genuinely happy for a moment.  At long, long, long, last he would be rid of #122142001122.  There would be no more futile attempts to persuade the prisoner to admit that he was whoever they had thought he was.  There would, he prayed, be no more terr

\rquote s attempts to escape from release would be an enjoyable challenge.  Challenges, enjoyable or otherwise, were rare things for the warden.
\par \tab With the prisoner no longer a mysteriously disturbing thorn in his side, the warden\rquote s life would be bearable once again.  He would
 spend his time reading, and thinking, and listening to music.  He would sometimes go down into the dungeons to visit the other three prisoners, pleasant intellectuals who had forgotten long ago exactly why they were in prison.  They were always pleased t

feet at all times, that the threat and the enigma remained with him.
\par \tab How ironic, he thought, that in the first days of his imprisonment, the prisoner could have just killed the guard and stayed in his cell.  Murder was one crime that even the False Impriso
nment Act could not pardon.  But with the introduction, long before the warden had become warden, of semi-human guards, the crime had become one of tampering with state property, and quite excusable in the case of an unjustly caged man.  Over the years, t
h
e prisoner had made a game of killing these semi-human guards by various cruel and unusual methods.  The warden had once suggested to his friend the Over-warden that replacing the prisoner with a half-man bred to be a prisoner was the obvious solution to 
this problem.
\par \tab The guards were effective, but not very intelligent, and certainly no match for the hostile and brilliant mind of #122142001122.  The warden would have to go with them into the deep levels.  He had tried to avoid thinking of this inescapable 
conclusion, but all of his thoughts led to it, and all of the paths his mind followed lead him down into the darkness and mystery.
\par \tab He stared into that darkness for a long time, his eyes resting unfocused on the singularly unsympathetic and disapproving eyes of the portrait of the previous warden that disfigured the corner of his office.
\par \tab The five guards entered his office through the open door, and he brought up the map of the prison.  The torturously claustrophobic winding stairway that had been called th
e Throat for countless centuries appeared in all of its three-dimensional dread on his desktop.  The semi-transparent walls of the circular levels surrounded it, forming a cylinder around the black helix.  The three upper-most levels were the prison libra
ry, the warden\rquote s quarters, and the guards\rquote 
 quarters, in ascending order.  Below these were the more utilitarian levels of the kitchen and the laundry machines.  The next ten layers were the cells.  They were arranged on corridors which radiated out from the
 circular central chambers through which the Throat wound on each level.  The prisoner\rquote 
s cell had been on the bottom-most of these levels, only fifteen feet from the door to the central chamber and the Throat.  The Throat extended below this layer on the m
odel for some distance, but it was surrounded by only a slight darkening of the air and a label indicating that the area was }{\b\f2 UNKNOWN (MAP INCOMPLETE)}{\f2 .
\par \tab The warden explained to the guards that they were entering uncharted territory, into which even he, the 
warden, had only ventured once, and of which he knew very little, almost nothing.  They were to follow him and watch with their superior eyes for the prisoner, who was to be captured alive if at all possible.  \'93
Be very cautious!  He will try to kill you as
 he killed his guard.  For some unknown reason he enjoys killing your kind very much, so you must be careful or I will be left alone to face him down there.  You are all to memorize our route, so that we can find our way out once we have recaptured the pr

\par \tab The guards did not have any questions.  They had already changed from guards into trackers and watchers and warriors trained to subdue, but not to kill.  This perfect adaptability was one of their strengths, and raised them well above the 
simpler semi-humans, who could only perform one kind of task well.  The warden looked into their smooth, uninterrupted faces of polished steel.  \'93Right.\'94  He stood up, lifting his ungainly mass with difficulty.  \'93Let\rquote s go.\'94

They made their way down the Throat slowly at first.  They were forced to travel single-file, and the warden had to bend over to avoid striking his head on the low ceiling.  His huge body brushed against the walls constantly, and he began to sweat profuse
l
y, slowing almost to a halt.  After a few minutes he realized that he would never be able to track the prisoner on foot--his monstrous body had completely swallowed the man he had once been.  He sat on the floor of the circular chamber on the second floor
 
and instructed one of the guards to bring his chair.  The guard returned after ten minutes with a small blue sphere.  The warden lifted it and pressed a button.  The sphere floated in the air, glowing with a faint blue light, and the warden turned around 
and sat on the invisible chair it had created for him.  On this cushion he traveled swiftly and silently down the Throat, and the group soon reached the lowest level of the prison.
\par \tab The warden floated to the prisoner\rquote s cell.  The guard was outside, leaning 
against the wall.  The spoon had entered his throat on one side and exited on the other, just below the bottom of the steel mask.  The floor was splattered with blood.  The cell was empty--the prisoner had taken his pillow with him.
\par \tab They returned to the T
hroat, and proceeded into the depths.  The first chamber the warden remembered.  It was a vast cavern of stone, polished and empty.  The walls were hundreds of yards from the landing of the Throat, which wound through empty space for a hundred feet before
 
touching ground, its usual claustrophobic effect replaced with an equally powerful acrophobic effect.  They passed the ceiling on the way down, and the warden noticed hand-holds on the black stone, metal rings which might be traveled by a brave or despera
te man.  \'93Guard, go along these and report to me where they lead.  Simply report back.  Do not leave this chamber.\'94
\par \tab The guard passed from rail to rail for almost a full minute, with the swiftness and sureness of the truly ignorant.  He reached for another 
ring, and as he did the one he was holding snapped.  He grabbed for the other ring, but it, too, broke away and he tumbled to the floor a hundred feet below, and struck it with a sickening thud.
\par \tab The warden suspected that the rungs had been deliberately weakened, that the prisoner had anticipated him already, but it was possible, he reflected, that the rings were simply old and weak--possible, but not likely.
\par \tab The gap which remained was too large for even the strongest and most agile of men to have crossed, so the warden continued down the stairs, followed by his loyal troops.  \'93That may have been the prisoner\rquote 
s first trap.  He will want to kill you all.  You must constantly keep an eye out for danger.\'94  With some of the more exotic semi-humans the warden\rquote s 
last phrase might have been literal, but none were better prepared to follow the order than the ever-watchful guards.
\par \tab When they reached the bottom, the warden surveyed the room. In the almost nonexistent light the walls were too far away to be seen.  He r
emembered that when he had last been here, he had followed the previous warden to a door, and that they had walked straight in the direction in which the Throat\rquote s last step pointed to reach it.  He floated that way and the guards followed silently.

\par \tab A few 
minutes later, they arrived at the small steel door.  The door was dwarfed by the walls which continued beyond it into darkness.  The warden paused before the door.  The passage beyond was where his recollection of his first and only visit to these region
s
 ended.  Beyond this point, his memories were only of a moment of pain and an eternity of blackness.  He had awakened at the bottom of the Throat.  The old warden had never been found, and twenty guards had vanished forever into the darkness.  After a wee
k of directing the fruitless search from the safety of his office, he had appointed himself warden of the prison.
\par \tab He opened the door, keeping it between himself and the gloomy space beyond, afraid that whatever had happened the last time he had entered that short hallway might happen again.
\par \tab The corridor beyond was short, only fifteen feet long.  Arches to the left and right opened onto small rooms full of unidentifiable piles of machinery and wiring.  The air beyond the portal was a few degrees warmer than
 that just before it, and there was a faint odor of decay in the air.  The warden floated in and the guards followed, searching the debris about them for signs of danger.  The warden passed beyond them, to the end of the hall, and into the room at there.

\par \tab 
The room was larger than the hall, twenty feet in all directions, and two passages exited it, one on the left and one on the right.  The walls were covered in writing.  Most of the neatly printed characters were ones with which the warden was not familiar
, but a small portion of the orderly graffiti was written in his own tongue.  He walked over to it, more curious than cautious, and the guards followed, being cautious for him.  Someone had written a famous passage from the chaos poetry on the wall:

\par With a running.
\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f2 
\par \tab The warden brushed his sausage-like fingers over the writing.  It was slightly raised from the wall, and seemed to vibrate at his touch.  He suspected that it had been embossed by machinery, but for what purpose he could not imagine.
\par \tab He turned aside and passed into the passage on the left.  A feather was lying on the ground, obviously pulled from the prisoner\rquote s pillow and left behind to taunt his pursuers.  \'93Be careful.  He\rquote 
s been here, and there will probably be a trap nearby.\'94
\par \tab They continued down the hallway.  A deep pit opened on their left, where the wall was broken and revealed a chamber with a large port
ion of its floor missing.  The warden peered over the edge, and saw a skeleton twenty feet below, the un-rotted clothing identifying it as one of the missing guards from his first excursion.
\par \tab The passage came to a dead end.  The warden retreated and took t
he other passage from the poetry room.  This passage was longer and fully intact.  Air vents on the ceiling blew chilled air down on them, and the warden shivered as the cold blasts played across the expanses of his flesh.  There was no door at the end of
 
this corridor, only an arch opening into a room almost as large as the chamber at the bottom of the Throat.  Where the vast spaces of that room had drifted into darkness, the surfaces of this room were nakedly exposed by a fierce light.  A sphere of unbea
rable brightness hung suspended from a cable in the center of the room, nearly blinding the group as they approached it along the refrigerated passage.
\par \tab As they entered the lit cavern, they heard a noise behind them.  They turned quickly, but only the warde
n, able to spin instantly on his invisible chair, caught a glimpse of the creature.  It was, he estimated, half the height of a man:  a thin ghost of ugly white flesh.  Its red eyes gleamed as they met his for the briefest of durations, and he thought he 
s
aw claws and fangs, but he was not really sure he had seen anything.  The form of the monster was taken directly from one of his recurring nightmares, the one in which wicked little white men with claws and fangs chased him among the labyrinthine stacks o
f the prison library.  The creature, if it had existed, had fled back into the poetry room.
\par \tab He decided not to pursue it.  He had not taken the long trip down the Throat in order to pursue phantasms through shadowy corridors.  He had taken it in order to pu
rsue the very real prisoner through those same shadowy corridors, and somehow his well-developed, if long dormant, skills told him that the prisoner had passed through the great chamber of light.
\par \tab He turned back.  \'93Did you see anything?\'94
\par \tab \'93No, sir.  We heard a noise, and turned, but there was nothing behind us.\'94
  He beckoned for them to follow him into the cavern.  Here the exits were clearly visible.  Twenty passages, counting the one at the head of which they stood, exited the circular room, evenly spaced along the walls.
\par \tab \'93Come on, we\rquote ll check them all.  He probably left a feather in front of one of them, and it\rquote s either a trap or the way he went--either way, it will tell us something.\'94  The guards followed without comment.
\par \tab The warden was correct.  The p
assage directly across the chamber from the one they had entered by was marked with a single feather.  The corridor was similar to the one they had entered by, a long steel hall of vent-chilled air blasts.  At the other end was a large and very dark room.
  Strange shapes loomed in the darkness and prevented the warden\rquote 
s light from revealing much more of the place than they could see directly in front of them.  The shapes appeared to be ruined machines and discarded storage containers.  The warden cautiously
 moved forwards.  Something about the place struck him as unbearably lonely, but in a triumphant rather than pathetic way:  here was a place which was proud of its desolation.  He moved over a small crab-like object, and it suddenly lit with a faint green
 glow and skittered away on its obscene insect-legs into the shadows, emitting a few mournful beeps.
\par \tab He followed it, passing over more pieces of discarded devices, none of which came to life.  He heard a sharp hiss of breath and started to turn, but was st
ruck by something before he saw more of what was behind him than a flash of white flesh.  Blackness took him, and he saw no more for some time.

\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f2 \tab When the warden awoke, he was no longer in the room of ruined parts.  He was lying on a street in a ruined ci
ty--miles, he imagined, below the tower.  Above him stretched abyssal darkness, a cavern far larger than anything he would have imagined was possible.  The only light was the pale blue luminosity of the ground.  He saw around him rows of dead houses and c
o
lumns of buildings that had been partly or completely reduced to rubble.  A moaning wind howled somewhere far away, though he could feel no movement in the air where he was.  In fact, the air was unnaturally still, as if it were weighted down and unable t
o
 move.  He sat up, and looked for his chair.  It and his light were gone, although his rations were untouched.  He stood up and brushed the dust off of his shirt.  The white dust stained his hands and he imagined that it gave his already pallid face a pos
itively ghastly appearance.
\par \tab The warden began to wander the streets.  He walked for hours without seeing anything other than ruined and abandoned dwellings and stores and offices.  He assumed they were dwellings and stores and offices--time had erased any d
ifferences between the buildings beyond size and architecture.  There were no wares in the stores, only dust.  A few of the buildings had pieces of metal in them that might have been parts of furniture, but nothing he could definitively establish as a bed
 or chair or desk.
\par \tab There was a shooting pain in his left side, but he ignored it, using the remnants of the stamina and stoic endurance he had once possessed.  Every ten or fifteen minutes he was forced to sit down and rest.  It was while he was resting th
at he saw another crab-like object on the floor of a particularly large building.  He kicked the thing, and it lit.  This time, instead of scurrying away, it circled around him rapidly, without beeping.  Then it started moving away from him, but slowly, a
n
d it paused whenever it was more than five feet away.  He staggered to his feet and followed, slowly, unsure what it might be or whether it might even somehow be a tool of the prisoner.  After a while it entered another building.  Inside this building he 
saw several crates, apparently untouched by whatever had ravaged the city.  He opened one, and inside was what he regarded as a gun.  He had never seen a real gun.
\par \tab He took it out and examined it.  He had seen many pictures of guns, and most of them looked 
dangerous.  This one looked deadly, and had obviously been designed by a master of psychology in order to convey instantly and very intensely the idea of threat.  The barrel was long and the six vibrating tubes underneath fed into a central bulb inside th
e electrical housing.  A \'93rifle,\'94
 he believed, was the proper terminology.  The rifle looked like something made for the highly specific purpose of killing things in an extremely unpleasant way.  He hefted it, feeling how light it was despite its impression of destructive weight.
\par \tab The crab creature had ceased to move.  He kicked it again, but it lay still and dark.  Apparently, its task completed, it had turned itself off.  Finally, he took the rifle and left, wondering why the crab creature had wanted to ar
m him.  He mentally shrugged.  Most of the world was incomprehensible.  To expect to be able to discern the motivations of tiny crab-like mechanisms scurrying through abandoned cities beneath ancient prisons was probably the height of hubris.
\par \tab He wandered 
a while longer, and grew hungry.  He sat down at the base of a broken statue, sweeping the shards of marble aside with his foot to make a resting place for his large fundament.  He pulled out his rations and again thanked God that whatever had attacked hi
m
 had not stolen his food as well as his light and chair.  He was just finishing the third of the bars when he saw a white figure moving through the shadows just beyond a pile of rubble.  He picked up the gun and carefully aimed it.  He drew in a deep brea
th and pulled the trigger.
\par \tab The black tip of the weapon glowed white for a brief instant, but nothing else happened.  A second later he noted that something else had actually happened, as the white figure toppled forwards and was hidden by the rubble.  The 
warden wondered if he had actually hurt it, or if it had seen the light of the gun and was pretending to be hit in order to lure him to it.  He was reasonably sure that if the creature wanted to catch him it would have no trouble doing so.  He had little 
to lose by going over to see what had happened to it.
\par \tab He stood, looked around, and then, having seen nothing moving, began to slowly walk towards the fallen monster.  He slowed to a halt at the edge of the rubble pile, then as swiftly as he could he rounde
d the corner and fired the gun.  Nothing happened.  The white thing was lying on the ground, face down, with no apparent wounds.  He kicked it.  Nothing happened.  He reached down and carefully touched it.  The white was in fact dust, and he was able to r
u
b some away.  The skin underneath was gray with specks of a sickening green, the same shade as the moss that lit the walls of the prison cells above.  He turned the creature over and saw his nightmare made flesh.  It did have wicked claws and red eyes and
 
sharp fangs.  It was only vaguely human, and in some way reminded him of a snake, although there was nothing really reptilian about it.  As he brushed the dust from its chest, he discovered something disturbing and inexplicable.  A number was written on i
ts chest, dyed in black ink.  }{\b\f2 #600033001005}{\f2 , the tattoo read.  The number, of course, was of the same form as a citizen\rquote s identification number, but obviously this thing was not a citizen of the Hierarchy.
\par \tab He examined the creature closely, but found nothin
g else of note.  Eventually, exhausted by his efforts, he crawled into a hole in a concrete barrier and went to sleep.  He slept fitfully, and dreamed that the prisoner and the angel were interrogating the gray and green creature in a huge torture chamber
,
 one such as the old warden had told him was hidden somewhere down here in the depths and had been used in the days when the Hierarchy had been somewhat less morally sound.  The angel and the prisoner kept asking the creature one question, again and again
, relentlessly beating and burning and cutting and strangling it, killing it a thousand times over.  }{\i\f2 \'93What is a man?  What is a man?  The heavens declare that you must answer, what is man?\'94}{\f2 
\par \tab He woke up unrested but unable to resume his sleep.  He wandered for four more days in this manner, traveling randomly and sleeping fitfully, slowly exhausting his rations and noticing the pain in his left side increase.
\par \tab Finally, he rounded a crest and saw before him a gathering of twenty of the white-dust coated monste
rs, and in the center of the group, tied to a pole, the prisoner.  He fired the rifle at the beasts, but before he could kill more than three of them they overwhelmed him. One of them sank its fangs into his arm and he lost consciousness.

\par \tab The warden realized with a sudden certainty that the man was himself.  He looked at his own body.  He was a thin, angular man, not quite six feet tall, with a two great cloth-covered bundles bound i
