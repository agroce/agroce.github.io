The summary may not be that helpful, if it is a paper you just really need to at least skim if you want to get the ideas.

This paper is a solid overview of the TSTL domain-specific language (and toolset) for software testing.  TSTL uses a nondeterministic choice-of-action with guards model, which is useful and easy to use; perhaps more important, TSTL offers the idea of using the DSL to build a general first-class library for test generation/manipulation for any SUT (software under test), hiding the details of the SUT itself.

The classic Hildebrandt-Zeller delta-debugging can usefully be applied not just to preserve the property "this test fails," but to reduce the size of a test while holding constant <i>any</i> property of interest.  The obvious application we demonstrate is improving regression testing by minimizing not just suites, but individual tests.  Can also boost seeded symbolic execution very nicely, however, which is less obvious.

(A quote from the paper is probably best here): We suspect that developers do not put as much effort as TBSM would ideally expect into testing because the payoff of testing is not always clear.  The relationship between test quality, even measured by mutation testing rather than coarse-grained coverage only, and detection and anticipation of important defects worth fixing, is not always extremely strong.  However, there is clearly some relationship between test quality and eventual system reliability, and one way to see TBSM (and future techniques of the same kind) is as a new way to get better tests.  Because most code does not have a critical bug, effort to write tests is currently seen as a burden, a "cost-center," not a "revenue-center" for developers, to adapt a business analogy.  It may have to be done, but testing is purely to ward off disaster.  However, TBSM offers a different way to look at tests:  high quality tests allow developers to be more productive, in that they enabled the automation of certain kinds of changes to the software.  Writing high-quality tests may become a much more pleasant part of software development if the payoff is not having to write as much complex code to, e.g., adapt a system to a more limited platform, or handle changes to system libraries, or produce a more secure version with a smaller attack surface due to removing insecure functionalities.  If tests can produce "productivity revenue" rather than simply allowing the detection of faults in previous productivity, they may be more valued, and receive more attention.  The upshot will be more reliable systems that are also easier to adapt to resource-limited situations.

  fuzzers (that is, figuring out which failing tests are the same bug for
  triaging).  The new approach uses mutants to improve failure ranking and
  shows that this can also be adapted to a novel approach to fault
  localization, which is more limited in scope (you want multiple
  failing tests, ideally for multiple bugs!), but works better than
  MUSE, MUSEUM, and Metallaxis-FL on many benchmark examples (often with
  less overhead), where it applies.  The use of mutants to determine

The security and testing communities have produced powerful tools, including symbolic execution engines and sophisticated fuzzers.  Unfortunately, not many developers know how to use these tools, learning one does not make learning another trivial, and the tools have significant limitations -- and bugs.  DeepState offers a front-end to such tools that resembles a unit testing framework such as Google Test, but allows generation of inputs via a selected back-end.  Right now, DeepState offers access to angr and Manticore, as well as Dr. Memory's fuzzer.  In the future, we plan to extend it to other back-ends.  In addition to this gain in ease of use (and ability to find a tool that works on your problem, DeepState also provides high-level heuristic aids to improve the performance of the back-ends.  This makes DeepState a powerful platform for exploring novel techniques to improve test generation.

<p>
<font face="Courier New">
We propose some (common-sense) methods for tracking and presenting the provenance of tests generated by automated test generation methods where new tests essentially derive from old tests, and can (usually) be traced back to some original, often simple and hand-crafted (or at least simple and valid) inputs.  The most interesting idea here is probably the proposal to "fake" a provenance in cases where either the algorithm itself or a post-processing step (like normalization) destroys it.  For such tests we can generate a plausible, if "untrue" causal story of how the test derives from seed inputs, and it seems reasonable to think that such "false" stories are, in a probabilistic setting, useful even if technically untrue, since the test could have been thus derived.  In fact, this suggests (not in the paper) the idea of made-up (Platonic/Straussian lie?) ML interpretations.  "This is not how I produced this result, but it's a simple story your little human head can handle, and not utterly impossible" might be a reasonable thing for an AI to say, in some circumstances.  What Elon Musk would think of such patronizing AIs, we don't speculate.

What if we have really good tests?  This paper proposes that labeling tests can serve as a convenient way to express adaptability constraints for software resource adaptation.  The idea is to 1) label some tests as ok to fail 2) use cause reduction/delta-debugging/hierarchical delta-debugging/statement deletion mutation (whichever you wish to think of it as) to produce variants of the program that pass all tests not labeled as ok to fail.  Test labeling is an easy way to express functionality, and restricting to statement deletion means that tests alone may suffice to avoid broken variants.  Case study:  by labeling three tests, we can remove undo/redo from NetBeans IDE and significantly reduce its memory usage.

This paper proposes a new, term-rewriting-based approach to semantic simplification of unit tests, providing both canonization to reduce duplicate tests for faults and additional size reduction beyond delta-debugging.  The paper also describes a (closely related) way to generalize a test to understand the neighborhood of failing tests, and distinguish accidental and essential aspects of a failure.  The approach is well-implemented in current TSTL release, and sufficiently useful that I basically always run random testing (if searching for actual bugs, not just running experiments for a paper) with normalization turned on.  It isn't quite obvious, but this paper is basically another in the series of papers (cause reduction being the previous one) concerning \emph{causality} in verification/testing that extend back to my thesis work at CMU and the model-checking error explanation/"What Went Wrong?" papers.

<p>
<font face="Courier New">
Using a novel method for evaluating a "testedness" measure (does a high measure for a program component predict few future defect corrections for that component?) we show that:  1) traditional testedness measures are not, in a continuous sense, very reliable (testedness is only weakly negatively correlated with future defects), but 2) choosing a threshold (say, is a component covered or not), less "tested" components have, on average, twice as many future fixes.  Upshot:  the traditional use of coverage measures and mutation scores in testing research may be dubious (small differences in score don't strongly imply anything), but using coverage/mutation as a simple rule-of-thumb to prioritize/evaluate testing is reasonably well supported.

Slippage takes place when delta-debugging reduces a test T failing due to fault A into a test R failing due to fault B.

We present two algorithms for both mitigating slippage and using it to find more faults, and a limited evaluation showing the utility of these methods.
